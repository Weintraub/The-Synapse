					<h1>Peter “Furious Pete” Czerwinski</h1>
					<h4> Personal Mental Health Experiences</h4>
					<p>Peter Czerwinski, better known by his stage name 'Furious Pete', is a competitive Canadian speed eater and
						fitness athlete. Czerwinski holds multiple Guinness World Records in eating, hosts a TV show in Europe, owns his
						own supplement company, and has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspJ-h5Mw9_zeEhJDzMpkkA">YouTube channel</a> with over 4 million subscribers. It has been an uphill battle
						for Pete, but dedication has been at the forefront of every goal he has achieved. After stumbling upon a talent he
						didn't know he had during a powerful and emotional encounter with anorexia, Furious Pete has gone on to gather
						many Guinness World Records including fastest time to eat a whole raw onion (43.53 seconds), consuming 17
						Jaffa cakes in 60 seconds, and fastest time to eat a 12" pizza (32 seconds), to name a few. He has since used his
						popularity in eating as a platform for many other amazing achievements, including documenting his successful
						'Road to 700lb Deadlift', and his battle with Testicular Cancer in 2014. He now proudly runs many successful
						businesses including his YouTube channel with over 4 million subscribers, his supplement company, Furious
						Formulations, and his fitness apparel company, Furious Apparel.

					<h1>Dr. Jeff Daskalakis</h1>
					<h4>All The Wonderful Things We Learn From Stimulating The Brain</h4>
					<p>As an expert on the neurophysiology of severe psychiatric disorders, Dr. Daskalakis leads the Temerty Centre
						for Therapeutic Brain Intervention. This centre uses magnetic brain stimulation to study the role of cortical
						inhibition and plasticity as potential pathophysiological mechanisms in schizophrenia, depression and obsessive
						compulsive disorder. Dr. Daskalakis also conducts treatment studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic brain 
						stimulation (rTMS) for refractory symptoms in these disorders. He has been a NARSAD Lieber Young
						Investigator (2004, 2006) a NARSAD Independent Investigator (2008) and holds CIHR , Brain Canada and OMHF
						operating grants. He has also been awarded the Samarthji Lal Award in Mental Health Research from the Graham
						Boeckh Foundation. Dr. Daskalakis has over 200 peer-reviewed publications and serves on the editorial board
						for <i>Biological Psychiatry</i>.

					<h1>Dr. Brandon Walters</h1>
					<h4>Controlling the Message: The Role of mRNA Methylation in learning and Memory</h4>
					<p>Dr. Brandon Walters graduated from Purdue University with a B.Sc. in genetics and moved to the University
						of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), where he completed a masters in Forensic Science followed by a Ph.D. in
						Neurobiology. Brandon completed his Ph.D. under the dual mentorship of Drs. Scott Wilson and Lynn Dobrunz,
						examining the interplay between protein degradation and synaptic function. He expanded his training by moving
						outside of the brain and pursuing a prestigious post-doctoral opportunity at St. Jude Children’s research hospital in
						Memphis TN, where he studied hearing regeneration. During his time there, Brandon created novel stem cell lines,
						and high throughput drug screens designed to aid in hearing regeneration of children post-chemotherapy. Brandon
						then moved up to Toronto to finish his training by re-focusing on learning and memory research in Dr. Sheena
						Josselyn’s lab at the Hospital for Sick Children. In the Josselyin lab, Brandon’s work helped to establish the new
						field of neuroepitranscriptomics, or the study of RNA modifications and how they influence learning and memory.
						Specifically, his work focuses on the role of RNA methylation in learning and memory, whereby he utilizes
						advanced gene editing techniques in combination with molecular biology and behavioural testing.

					<h1>Dr. John Cunningham</h1>
					<h4> Internet Interventions for Problem Drinkers</h4>
					<p>Professor John Cunningham (Ph.D., experimental psychology, University of Toronto, 1995) works in the
						intersection between clinical and population health. His research is driven by the question, “how do people change
						from addictive behaviours?” To answer this question, John has combined population research methods with
						clinical and other research traditions. The findings from these studies have been translated into a series of brief
						interventions for people with hazardous alcohol use, or other addictions concerns, that can be applied in treatment
						or community settings. John currently holds a Canada Research Chair in Addictions, is a Senior Scientist at the
						Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and a Professor at the University of Toronto.

					<h1>Dr. Colin Hawco</h1>
					<h4> Neuroimaging Mental Illness: A Biological Measure for Biological Disorders</h4>
					<p>Dr. Hawco is a cognitive neuroscientist working in neuroimaging and brain stimulation at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health, and an Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto. He received his PhD in Neuroscience from McGill in 2012.  Dr. Hawco’s work focuses on using neuroimaging, specifically functional magnetic resonance imaging, to examine the neurobiology of mental illnesses. He also works on brain stimulation, both as a way to probe brain function and as a treatment for mental illness. Most recently, he has focused on novel approaches to examine individual variability, as well as working towards identifying biologically derived sub-types of schizophrenia and depression. At present, diagnostic categories of mental health are based on symptoms; but the symptoms are not the underlying cause of these disorders, merely the expression. In order to advance mental health treatment, we need to understand the underlying biology behind these illnesses at a group level, but at the level of the individual.
